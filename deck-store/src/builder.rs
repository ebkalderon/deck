//! Asynchronous builder for a set of packages.
//!
//! # Graph structure
//!
//! The build graph that this `Builder` generates always downloads sources in parallel and builds
//! packages in parallel where possible, serializing only where necessary.
//!
//! For example, given a package dependency graph like this:
//!
//! ```text
//! +------+
//! | quux |
//! +--+---+
//!    |
//!    v
//! +-----+       +-----+
//! | foo |       | bar |
//! +--+--+       +--+--+
//!    |             |
//!    +-----+ +-----+
//!          | |
//!          v v
//!        +-----+
//!        | baz |
//!        +-----+
//! ```
//!
//! The builder will generate a build graph like this:
//!
//! ```text
//! +---------------+                 +--------------+
//! | download_quux |                 | download_bar |
//! +------+--------+                 +--------+-----+
//!        |                                   |
//!        v                                   v
//! +------------+   +--------------+    +-----------+
//! | build_quux |   | download_foo |    | build_bar |
//! +------+-----+   +------+-------+    +-----+-----+
//!        |                |                  |
//!        +-----+   +------+                  |
//!              |   |                         |
//!              v   v                         |
//!          +-----------+   +--------------+  |
//!          | build_foo |   | download_baz |  |
//!          +-----+-----+   +-------+------+  |
//!                |                 |         |
//!                +-------+  +------+         |
//!                        |  |  +-------------+
//!                        |  |  |
//!                        v  v  v
//!                     +-----------+
//!                     | build_baz |
//!                     +-----------+
//! ```
//!
//! Notice that the `download_*` steps don't have any direct dependencies, meaning they can all run
//! in parallel, even while the `build_*` steps may block.
//!
//! Once the `Builder` is eventually transformed into a `BuildStream`, the whole build graph is
//! fully self-contained inside the `BuildStream`, ready to be processed with `for_each()` on an
//! executor.
